UNLIMITED UNDO
==============

"To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction"
   Newtons 3rd law.

To enable the new unlimited undo functionality it is first necessary to enable
the global undo mode by adding the following command to init.lsp.

  (add-mode-global "undo") 

When undo mode is enable any non special buffers (buffers that dont start with *
as the first character of the buffer name) will have undo mode enabled when
the buffer is first created.

C-u will activate the undo command.  As long as the user types C-u the next
undo in the list will be visited and the undo action taken.

When undo mode is not active the old undo behaviour will be invoked when C-u is
pressed.  This will only undo or redo the last command.  The old undo
behaviour will be removed at some later date once the new unlimited-undo code
has had time to bed in and gain exposure to a wider set of users.


MONITORING UNDO MEMORY
======================

As unlimited undo contains the entire change history of the buffer,
(for the period of the edit session), it can result in almost as much
memory being allocated for the undo steps as the buffer itself.  There are
two hidden (and non bound) commands that can be used to monitor how much
memory is being used by undo.

 Esc-x list-undo        ;; will show a report of all the undo structures for the current buffer

Num Type   Point     Size String
--- ------ --------- ---- ----------------------------------------
001 INSERT       213   33 g
002 BACKSP       212   33 f
003 INSERT      3431   53 rney, 26 October 2016
004 BACKSP      3410   34 nt


The size is the total number of bytes used by the undo structure plus the size of the
allocated u_string member.  The Undos are numbered 1-N with 1 being the latest undo 
recorded.  The string is a 40 byte summary of the undo BUT with any control chars
replaced with spaces.


 Esc-x list-stats-undo  ;; shows a report of how much is used across ALL buffers

Buffer            Num      Size
---------------- ---- ---------
*completions*       0         0
undo.txt          245     13161

  Num is the number of undos recorded for that buffer
  Size is the total size of all undo records for that buffer

 Esc-x discard-undo-history  ;; throws away all the undo history 
                             ;; and will start accumulating it again
                             ;; when changes start being made


HOW UNDO WORKS
==============
A limited set of functions are paired together that are mutual and exact opposites.

 BACKSPACE undoes INSERT and vice-versa
 KILL-REGION undoes YANK and vice-versa
 DELETE undoes INSERT-AT and vice-versa

It is important that each of the above functions do not result in calls to
each other and they must not be paired to another function other than its pair.

As edits take place the calling function registers an undo record
by calling add_undo(). All the calls to add_undo are in command.c

To save memory consecutive single character inserts, backspace or deletes are
accumulated onto the previous undo structure of the same function type.

When Undo is invoked the paired function is called with the correct point location
having been setup.   The paired function will itself result in a new undo record
being added to the tail of the undo list.  This means that a single sequential
list of undo structures is maintained that contained the entire history of
all tracked changes to the buffer.



ISSUES THAT WIL BE FIXED LATER
(please dont report these)
==============================
WARNING ! Replaces are not yet supported  
  If you need to do replaces you should save the file first
  Re-open the file and then do the replace, save the file.
  Or you should use ESC-x discard-undo-history
  This will avoid having an invalid UNDO history when you have done a replace

Not yet handling utf8 chars that are inserted or backspaced  (fixed in 1.10)
Not yet handling some of the special cases that exist in overwrite mode


REPORTING PROBLEMS WITH UNDO
============================

Hopefully I have caught most of the problems during testing.
I have been mostly using FemtoEmacs to develop undo.c so it has
had a lot of use during development.

The most likely failures will be assertion failure.
Please work out the exact shortest steps to hit the assertion failure.
For example (1 insert, followed by a cut) was one example that
reproduced a defect during development.  There is no point reporting
an assertion failure if you cant give me the steps to reproduce it.

If you experience a core dump then it would be useful for you to 
send me a backtrace so I can see the call sequence prior to the failure.
Instructions for doing this are below.

Enjoy, Hugh Barney, 26 October 2016



INSTRUCTIONS - HOW TO DEBUG SEGFAULTS
=====================================
1) add -g option onto CFLAGS in the makefile.
2) do a make clean and a make
3) At the shell point make sure core dumps are enabled.
4) ulimit -c unlimited    ##  this allows core files to be written to disk
5) run the programme and get the SEGFAULT
6) check that a file called core now exists.  If not check out how to enable CORE dumps on a MAC
7) run the gdb debugger

Reference Run of List-Undos 5 Nov 2016
======================================
The report below shows the effect of editing and undoing 
using the DEL key (CTRL+D) and then an UNDO.
You should start at the bottom and work up for the full story
The latest undo is at the top.

Notice that the INSAT lines for UTF8 chars for
undo 008 and 009 appear corrupt.
THIS IS NOT A BUG.  What is happening here
is that the UTF8 char sequence was inserted using insert_at() in reverse order in order
to ensure that when the undo was completed they are in the correct order in the file.
This means that they no longer appear as printable chars in the report below.


(Potential Fix)
This is a cosmetic issue in a debug function.
However when time allows it could be eliminted by editing the code in
command.c: insert_at() so that it takes an argument of char_t *
Then all of the UTF8 can be passed in one go, inserted in one go
and then the call to add_undo() can pass the char_t * back in one go
as well.   As insert_at() is only used by undo this approach will work.
This would take 2-4hrs including testing.
